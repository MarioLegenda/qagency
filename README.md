## SETUP

There are two ways to setup this project; via your host system with 
webpack or with docker. If you choose to setup with webpack, required
version of node is 16.

### SETTING UP WITH WEBPACK

``yarn install``

``yarn serve``

And that is it. webpack should open your default browser and run
the application.

### SETTING UP WITH DOCKER

``docker-compose up``

Your application should now be available on `http://localhost:9000`.
